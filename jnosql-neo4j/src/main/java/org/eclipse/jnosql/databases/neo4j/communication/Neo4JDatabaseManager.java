/**
 * This specialization of {@link DatabaseManager} is designed for Neo4j databases.
 *
 * <p>Neo4j does not natively support Time-To-Live (TTL) operations, but TTL can be managed
 * using the APOC library. Implementations of this interface should handle TTL-related methods
 * accordinglyâ€”either by integrating APOC's TTL features or throwing {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
 * if TTL is not supported.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Usage Example:</h3>
 * <pre>
 * Neo4JDatabaseManager manager = ...; // Obtain an instance
 * CommunicationEntity entity = CommunicationEntity.of("User");
 * entity.add("name", "Alice");
 * entity.add("age", 30);
 *
 * manager.insert(entity); // Insert into Neo4j
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Notes:</h3>
 * <p>Ensure proper transaction and session management when implementing this interface.
 * Unsupported TTL operations should result in an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.</p>
